// QUICK NOTES
//
// Panels and Tools
// - Every window is associated with a single top-level GUI element.
// - Each top-level element is made up of a collection of panels, with each panel able to be split a
//   maximum of 1 time, either horizontally or vertically.
// - Each unsplit panel can have any number of "tools" attached to it.
// - Each panel can be assigned a type which is defined as a string, and is optional. The type is mainly
//   used to allow an application to make use of special panels for serving a specific type of task.
// - A tool is a GUI element that has 1 particular task. Examples could include text editors, log output
//   windows, project explorer's, etc.
// - When multiple tools are attached to a single panel, the panel uses tabs to allow the user to switch
//   between them.
// - Tools are unaware of the panel they are attached to and are designed such that they can be used
//   independantly.
// - Both panels and tools are just GUI elements with associated user-data. There is no "ak_panel" or
//   "ak_tool" object - they are just drgui_element objects.
// - Tools and panels should be deleted with drgui_delete_element(), however they should be first
//   disassociated with the relevant parts of the application.
