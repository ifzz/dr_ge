//
// QUICK NOTES
//
// If you've stumbled across this library, be aware that this is very, very early in development. A lot of APIs
// are very temporary, in particular the effects API which at the moment are tied very closely to DirectSound.
//
// Currently, the only backend available is DirectSound while I figure out the API. 
//
// General
// - This library is NOT thread safe. Functions can be called from any thread, but it is up to the host application
//   to do synchronization.
// - This library is only concerned with playback and recording of raw audio data. It does not load audio files
//   such as WAV, OGG and MP3.
// - Before you can create an output (playback) or input (recording) device you need to first create a context.
// - Each backend (DirectSound, ALSA, etc.) has it's own context. Using easyaudio_create_context() will find
//   a backend implementation based on the platform easy_audio has been compiled for.
// - A context for a specific backend can be created as well. For example, easyaudio_create_context_dsound() will
//   create a context which uses DirectSound as it's backend.
// - Currently, devices are enumerated once when the context is created. Thus, when a device is plugged in or
//   unplugged it will not be detected by easy_audio and the context will need to be deleted and re-created.
// - Currently, easy_audio will only consider the first EASYAUDIO_MAX_DEVICE_COUNT output and input devices, which
//   is currently set to 16 and should be plenty for the vast majority of cases. Feel free to increase (or decrease)
//   this number to suit your own requirements.
//
// Events
// - Events are handled via callbacks. The different types of events include stop, pause, play and markers.
// - The Stop event is fired when an output buffer is stopped, either from finishing it's playback or if it was
//   stopped manually.
// - The Pause event is fired when the output buffer is paused.
// - The Play event is fired when the output buffer begins being played from either a stopped or paused state.
// - A Marker event is fired when the playback position of an output buffer reaches a certain point within the
//   buffer. This is useful for streaming audio data because it can tell you when a particular section of the
//   buffer can be filled with new data.
// - Due to the inherent multi-threaded nature of audio playback, events can be fired from any thread. It is up
//   to the application to ensure events are handled safely.
// - Currently, the maximum number of markers is set by EASYAUDIO_MAX_MARKER_COUNT which is set to 4 by default. This
//   can be increased, however doing so increases memory usage for each sound buffer.
//
// Performance Considerations
// - Creating and deleting buffers should be considered an expensive operation because there is quite a bit of thread
//   management being performed under the hood. Prefer caching sound buffers.
//

//
// OPTIONS
//
// #define EASYAUDIO_NO_DIRECTSOUND
//   Disables support for the DirectSound backend. Note that at the moment this is the only backend available for
//   Windows platforms, so you will likely not want to set this. DirectSound will only be compiled on Win32 builds.
//

//
// TODO
//
// - DirectSound: Consider using Win32 critical sections instead of events where possible.
// - DirectSound: Remove the semaphore and replace with an auto-reset event.
// - Implement a better error handling API.
// - Implement effects
// - Implement velocity
// - Implement cones
// - Implement attenuation min/max distances
