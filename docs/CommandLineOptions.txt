--editor <file path (optional)>
  Open the editor and open the given (optional) file. Can be specified multiple times to
  open multiple files.
  
--portable
  Launch the game in portable mode. Portable mode uses the executable's directory as the
  base location for configs, saves, logs, etc. so that per-user directories can be
  avoided. This makes it easier to place a copy of the game on a USB drive or whatnot.

--silent
  Disables printing of log messages to stdout.
